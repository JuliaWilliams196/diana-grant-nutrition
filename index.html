                <p>Hi! I’m Diana.</p>
                <p>I’m a Certified Nutritional Practitioner (also known as a holistic nutritionist) in
                    Toronto and am registered through the Canadian Association of Holistic Nutrition Professionals. I’m
                    also a certified Functional Blood Chemistry Analyst.</p>

                <p>Alongside being a nutritionist, I’ve also been an Ontario Certified Teacher since 2010. I’ve taught
                    junior kindergarten through grade 12 in Toronto, South Korea, and in China!</p>

                <p>I’ve volunteered in various nursing homes, as well as with hospice care, and those experiences both
                    greatly shaped my interest in working in the healthcare field. In addition, over the years I have
                    seen loved ones struggle with both cognitive decline and poor mental health, and I have seen how
                    difficult it is for the person suffering and their own loved ones.</p>

                <p> As a teacher, I have seen many
                    children and adolescents struggle with learning, with anxiety, and with their relationship with
                    food. With my background in both education and in the health field, I strive to educate others so
                    that they can make informed decisions and to make the best decisions possible for their health.</p>

                <h2>What is Holistic Nutrition?</h2>
                <p>Practitioners of holistic nutrition take into account the whole person when they prescribe protocols.
                    These protocols can include dietary, supplement, and lifestyle recommendations, and may involve
                    botanicals (herbs). We dive deep and strive to uncover the root cause(s) of any imbalances or
                    dysfunctions in the body.
